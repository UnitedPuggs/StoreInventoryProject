# StoreInventoryProject
Project for a Database Management class that explores the usage of PHP and HTML in relation to a MySQL database hosted on a CSUF webserver in order to create a theoretical inventory, customer tracking, and order tracking system for a theoretical store!

## Inventory Management 
Within the limits of time and features (and feature depth required), some options were added in allowing for adding to items, "buying" items, and checking order statuses and creating alerts for items that needed to be ordered
